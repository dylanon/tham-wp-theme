How to set images on Past page:
- Use these custom fields when editing the Past page:
  - Section Image - Actor
  - Section Image - Creator
  - Section Image - Director
  - Section Image - Teacher
- Simply paste a direct link to your desired image in the Value field (should end with .jpg, .png, or another image file type) and click Update.
- Note: Only edit the Value field - Changing the Name field will break this functionality.
